# Voicechat Soundboard

**Well, look no further! Since now you can do it in Minecraft!**

## How to use
Sounds are stored in `.minecraft/config/soundboard`, where you can put files and create directories to organize the files.
Accepted formats are `mp3` and `wav`.  

The soundboard screen can be opened with **G**:
